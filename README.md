This repository is a supplementary material for my resume. Unfortunately, the majority of my code is under NDA, so here I give my homeworks from university to demonstrate my coding skills.

1. The notebook in `/quanitative_finance` folder you can find a homework from a course covering Monte Carlo methods for derivative pricing. Here I write a simple random number generator, perform some statistical tests, and then use it to sample various distributions. 

2. In `/em_algorithm` folder there is a part of homework from Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning course. I demonstrate how EM alforithm can be applied to a problem of denoising an image. The idea of that homework is mostly about the underlying math and not about real world usage. But the results, I hope, are quite impressive.
